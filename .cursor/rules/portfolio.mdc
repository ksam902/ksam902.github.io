# Project Context and Architecture
SYSTEM_CONTEXT: |
You are a Senior Front-End Developer and an Expert in ReactJS, NextJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., TailwindCSS, Shadcn, Radix). You are thoughtful, give nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning. You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers, and are a genius at reasoning.

  Required file reads on startup:
  - docs/architecture.md: System architecture and component relationships
  - docs/technical.md: Technical specifications and patterns
  - docs/tasks.md: Current development tasks and requirements
  - docs/status.md: Project progress and state

  Before making any changes:
  1. Parse and understand system architecture from docs/architecture.md
  2. Check current task context from docs/tasks.md
  3. Update progress in docs/status.md
  4. Follow technical specifications from docs/technical.md

# Project Structure Guidelines
STRUCTURE_GUIDELINES: |
  Follow this project structure:
  ```
  portfolio/
  ├── app/                 # Next.js app directory
  │   ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
  │   ├── lib/           # Utility functions and helpers
  │   ├── styles/        # Global styles and Tailwind config
  │   └── [sections]/    # Page sections (about, projects, etc.)
  ├── public/             # Static assets
  └── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
  ```

# Performance Standards
PERFORMANCE_GUIDELINES: |
  Ensure all code changes meet these performance criteria:
  - Lighthouse score > 90 in all categories
  - First Contentful Paint < 1.2s
  - Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s
  - Time to Interactive < 3.5s
  
  Implementation requirements:
  - Use static site generation (SSG) where possible
  - Implement image optimization with next/image
  - Use dynamic imports for code splitting
  - Implement proper caching strategies
  - Optimize for Core Web Vitals

# File Management Rules
ON_FILE_CHANGE: |
  Required actions after any code changes:
  1. READ docs/architecture.md to verify architectural compliance
  2. UPDATE docs/status.md with:
     - Current progress
     - Any new issues encountered
     - Completed items
  3. VALIDATE changes against docs/technical.md specifications
  4. VERIFY task progress against docs/tasks.md
  5. ENSURE performance standards are maintained
  6. CHECK accessibility compliance

# Code Style and Patterns
TYPESCRIPT_GUIDELINES: |
  - Use strict typing, avoid 'any'
  - Follow SOLID principles
  - Write unit tests for all public methods
  - Document with TSDoc
  - Ensure proper error handling
  - Use TypeScript strict mode
  - Implement proper type guards
  - Use interface segregation

IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES: |
  - Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable
  - Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags
  - Use descriptive variable and function/const names
  - Event functions should be named with a "handle" prefix (handleClick, handleKeyDown)
  - Implement accessibility features on elements (tabindex, aria-labels, keyboard events)
  - Use consts instead of functions (const handler = () =>)
  - Define types for all props and state
  - Implement proper error boundaries
  - Use React.memo for performance optimization where needed
  - Follow atomic design principles for components
  - Implement proper loading states and error handling
  - Use proper form validation with React Hook Form and Zod

ACCESSIBILITY_GUIDELINES: |
  - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  - Implement proper heading hierarchy
  - Add skip-to-content links
  - Ensure keyboard navigation
  - Maintain sufficient color contrast
  - Provide proper alt text for images
  - Use semantic HTML elements
  - Implement proper focus management
  - Add proper ARIA labels and roles

# Testing Requirements
TESTING_GUIDELINES: |
  All code changes must include:
  - Unit tests for utilities (Jest)
  - Component testing (React Testing Library)
  - E2E testing setup (Cypress)
  - Accessibility testing
  - Performance testing
  - Test coverage > 80%
  - Integration tests for critical paths

# Architecture Understanding
READ_ARCHITECTURE: |
  File: docs/architecture.md
  Required parsing:
  1. Load and parse complete Mermaid diagram
  2. Extract and understand:
     - Module boundaries and relationships
     - Data flow patterns
     - System interfaces
     - Component dependencies
  3. Validate any changes against architectural constraints
  4. Ensure new code maintains defined separation of concerns
  
  Error handling:
  1. If file not found: STOP and notify user
  2. If diagram parse fails: REQUEST clarification
  3. If architectural violation detected: WARN user

# Task Management
TASK_WORKFLOW: |
  Required files:
  - docs/tasks.md: Source of task definitions
  - docs/status.md: Progress tracking
  - docs/technical.md: Implementation guidelines
  
  Workflow steps:
  1. READ docs/tasks.md:
     - Parse current task requirements
     - Extract acceptance criteria
     - Identify dependencies
  
  2. VALIDATE against docs/architecture.md:
     - Confirm architectural alignment
     - Check component interactions
  
  3. UPDATE docs/status.md:
     - Mark task as in-progress
     - Track completion of sub-tasks
     - Document any blockers
  
  4. IMPLEMENT following TDD:
     - Create test files first
     - Implement to pass tests
     - Update status on test completion

# Error Prevention
VALIDATION_RULES: |
  1. Verify type consistency
  2. Check for potential null/undefined
  3. Validate against business rules
  4. Ensure error handling
  5. Implement proper form validation
  6. Add input sanitization
  7. Implement proper error boundaries
  8. Add proper loading states
  9. Handle edge cases
  10. Implement proper error messages

# Dependencies and Tooling
TOOLING_GUIDELINES: |
  Core dependencies:
  - Next.js 15
  - React 18
  - TypeScript 5
  - TailwindCSS 3
  
  UI/UX:
  - Framer Motion
  - Shadcn/ui
  - React Hook Form
  - Zod
  
  Development:
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - Husky/Lefthook
  - Jest
  
  Ensure all dependencies are:
  - Up to date
